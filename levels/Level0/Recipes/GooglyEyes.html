                            <h2>Steps:</h2>
                            <ol>
                    <li>Find the Googly Eyes recipe program ( googly_eyes.pde ) and open it using Processing.</li>

                    <li>Find an image on the internet and drop it into your sketch.  It can be anything as long as it has large eyes!</li>

                    <li>On line 1 of your sketch (outside of the methods) declare a variable for the image:
<pre>   PImage face;
</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>In your setup() method, import your image using the following code:
<pre>
    face = loadImage(“face.jpg”);
</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you need to, change the code you just entered so that “face.jpg” matches the name of your picture.  </li>

                    <li>Set the size of your sketch and the size of your image to be the same by entering the following code in the setup method.  
<pre>    size(800,600);
    face.resize(width,height);
</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>At the start of the draw() method, make your face the background of the sketch.
<pre>    background(face);
</pre></li>
                    <li>In the draw() method, place a white ellipse over the left eye of your image.<br> HINT: To find out where to put it, add code to print the mouseX and mouseY where you click the mouse. </li>

                    <li>Now add a pupil (the black part) to the left eye earlier.</li>

                    <li>Use mouseX and mouseY to move the left pupil where the mouse moves.  </li>

                    <li>Add a white ellipse over the right eye using the same technique used for the left eye.</li>

                    <li>Add a right pupil and make it move by using mouseX + [distance from left eye] and mouseY + [distance from left eye].</li>

                    <li>Here’s the tricky part: stop the pupils from going outside of the white circles!  To do this, imagine a rectangle that the pupil should stay within.  When mouseX and mouseY goes outside of these bounds, set it back to the boundary.  Put this code before you draw the pupils.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done. 
            </li>
